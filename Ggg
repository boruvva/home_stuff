**Focusing on Developer-Specific Tasks**:
   - I aim to enhance my technical skills by concentrating more on core developer tasks such as coding, debugging, and performance optimization. This will help me become more efficient and contribute to faster project completion.
   - **Impact**: By refining these skills, I can deliver higher-quality code and support timely project deliveries, reducing delays and improving overall project timelines.

2. **Expanding Test Automation Coverage**:
   - I plan to improve the coverage of automated tests by incorporating advanced testing frameworks like Selenium, JUnit, or Cypress. This will ensure comprehensive testing and increase the reliability of our codebase.
   - **Impact**: Enhanced test automation will lead to fewer bugs, faster detection of issues, and a more robust and maintainable codebase, benefiting both current and future projects.
